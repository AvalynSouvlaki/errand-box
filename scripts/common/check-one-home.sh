# check-one-home.sh - does any sentence appear in two documents?
#
# THE DEFECT: one fact with two homes. docs/conventions/prose.md has always
# said every fact lives in exactly one document, and nothing checked it, so it
# drifted the way an unchecked rule always drifts. The copy a reader trusts is
# then whichever they saw first, and the one that is wrong is invisible until
# somebody notices the two disagree.
#
# WHAT IT COST, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSERTED. A project built from this
# template accumulated 8 sentences appearing verbatim in two documents and 3
# whole sections that were near-copies of a convention, in a file that opened
# by saying it restated nothing. Its maintainer cut that file from 149 lines to
# 66. This template's own tree, checked for the first time on 2026-08-28, held
# 42 duplicated sentences of 8 words or more, including 5 in the very skeleton
# it ships for that job.
#
# -- THE FIRST RUN OF THE INSTRUMENT REPORTED ZERO, AND WAS WRONG ----------
#
# It reported no duplicates at any threshold, over a 60-file document set,
# and the reason was that its file collector matched NOTHING: a quoted pathspec
# reached git through a shell that treats a single quote as an ordinary
# character. Zero duplicates over zero files reads exactly like a clean tree.
#
# That is why this file ends by refusing to report success over an empty
# scope, and why the collector below is deliberately dull. A guard that cannot
# distinguish "nothing wrong" from "nothing examined" is not a guard.
#
# -- THE EXEMPTIONS, AND WHY EACH IS NOT A LOOPHOLE --------------------------
#
# THE ENTRY-POINT ROUTERS ARE EXEMPT FROM EACH OTHER, AND ONLY FROM EACH
# OTHER. A router states the absolutes in full, on purpose: a session may be
# handed exactly one router and nothing else, and a rule it has to follow a
# link to read is a rule it will not read. A sentence shared between a router
# and any OTHER file is still refused, so the exemption cannot be used to seed
# a copy into the tree. This project has one router, AGENTS.md, so the
# exemption does nothing until a second router joins the list below.
#
# docs/history/ IS EXEMPT ENTIRELY. A superseded page states things the live
# pages now state differently, which is the whole point of it.
# docs/methodology/history.md carries that rule.
#
# -- WHAT IT CANNOT SEE ----------------------------------------------------
#
# It compares SENTENCES, so a fact restated in different words passes and fails
# a review instead. That is the same split every other prose rule here has: the
# linter owns the mechanical half and the reading owns the rest. The
# mechanical half is still worth having, because verbatim duplication is what
# copy-and-paste actually produces.
#
# Headings, table rows, fenced blocks and code spans are excluded. A shared
# command is not a shared fact, and two documents naming the same file in a
# table is a cross-reference rather than a copy.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/common/check-one-home.sh
#   sh scripts/common/check-one-home.sh --json
#
# Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 a sentence has two homes, 2 could not run.
#
# Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
