# check-changelog.sh - does CHANGELOG.md still obey the four rules that a
# machine can hold?
#
# The defect this exists to catch is a changelog that stopped being orderable.
# docs/conventions/docs.md states four rules and says in as many words that
# each is mechanical enough to check. Nothing checked them, which is the exact
# shape this template warns about: a rule stated in a document and enforced by
# nobody is a preference, and a preference stated as a rule is what makes an
# agent stop believing the rules that matter.
#
# In the project this came from, the file drifted in all four ways at once:
# entries landing mid-file, one section ascending while the rest descended, and
# headings with no date to order by.
#
# -- WHAT IT CHECKS ----------------------------------------------------------
#   1. NEWEST FIRST. Dates inside a section descend. This is the rule that
#      breaks most often, because appending is what an editor does by default.
#   2. Every entry heading carries a date, ISO 8601. Several entries sharing
#      one day cannot be ordered from what was written down, so a full UTC
#      stamp is accepted and a bare date is accepted; no date is not.
#   3. Every entry names its record. An entry with no record is a claim.
#   4. Every entry says whether it deployed. Silence is not an answer;
#      "not deployed" is.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK IS WHETHER AN ENTRY IS TRUE. That is a
# reading and it belongs to the claim audit, docs/methodology/reviews.md lens 3.
# A guard that tried to verify prose would either pass vacuously or refuse
# legitimate writing, and both are worse than an honest scope.
#
# NO CHANGELOG IS "COULD NOT RUN", NOT "PASS". A project with no CHANGELOG.md
# has not broken these rules and has not satisfied them either, and reporting
# green over an absent file is how a check quietly stops applying. Exit 2.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/common/check-changelog.sh
#   sh scripts/common/check-changelog.sh --json
#   sh scripts/common/check-changelog.sh --file path/to/CHANGELOG.md
#
# Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 a rule was broken, 2 could not run.
#
# Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.

# nothing, the problem count parsed as zero, and the check reported a clean
# changelog it had never read. A guard that passes vacuously is worse than
