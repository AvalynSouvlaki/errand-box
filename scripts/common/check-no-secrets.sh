# check-no-secrets.sh - does any file in this tree carry something that must
# not be published?
#
# THE SCOPE IS TRACKED PLUS UNTRACKED-BUT-NOT-IGNORED, not tracked alone.
# `git ls-files` cannot see a file that has never been staged, which is exactly
# when a new file is most likely to carry a credential and exactly what the
# next `git add -A` would take. This header said "tracked" for longer than the
# code did.
#
# The defect this exists to catch is a credential, or a fingerprint of a private
# system, reaching a remote. Once it does, a history rewrite does not undo it:
# the value was readable, and it may be cached, mirrored or already indexed.
# Rotation is the fix; this is what stops it needing one.
#
# IT FINDS THE SHAPES IT KNOWS, AND A GREEN RUN IS NOT A CLEARANCE.
# It cannot find a password that looks like a word, a hostname that reads as
# prose, or a page of correct-looking examples that happens to describe a real
# system. It narrows the reading. It does not replace it.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/common/check-no-secrets.sh              tracked + untracked
#   sh scripts/common/check-no-secrets.sh --public     also the fingerprint rules
#   sh scripts/common/check-no-secrets.sh --json
#   sh scripts/common/check-no-secrets.sh --all-history   slow; scans every blob
#
# --public adds the rules that only matter for a repository that is or will be
# public: emails, absolute home paths, long hex identifiers. In a private
# project those are legitimate content, which is why they are not the default.
#
# Exit codes: 0 nothing found, 1 something found, 2 could not run.
#
# Read the exit code from this process, unpiped. Piping it into anything
# reports the pipeline's status, so a run that failed reads as green.
