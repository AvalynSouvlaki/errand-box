# check-gate.sh - run the whole local gate, in one command, and read every
# exit code from the process that produced it.
#
# The defect this exists to catch is a gate that is a LIST. Part (a) of
# docs/methodology/gate.md names several checks, and a list run by hand is run
# in the order somebody recalls it. The session that first wrote this ran its
# gate five times and typed a different subset each time. Nothing failed; the
# gate simply was not the same gate twice.
#
# IT DELEGATES. It holds no rules of its own and it is not a second opinion
# about anything. Every verdict here is some other script's, read unpiped.
#
# -- A SKIPPED CHECK IS A SKIP, NEVER A PASS -----------------------------
#
# A check exits 2 when it cannot run: git or awk is missing, or the file it
# reads is not there yet. A runner that quietly dropped one and printed green
# would be the row in docs/conventions/forbidden-patterns.md that reads *a step
# that exits 0 having done nothing it was asked to do*.
#
# So a skip is counted, named, and printed on its own line. The exit code is
# still 0, because a machine that cannot run a check has not failed it; pass
# --strict to make a skip a failure, which is what a CI job should do, since
# there the tools are installed on purpose and a skip means the install broke.
#
# Every check here runs with no network. scripts/common/README.md says why.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/common/check-gate.sh
#   sh scripts/common/check-gate.sh --strict   # a skip is a failure
#   sh scripts/common/check-gate.sh --json
#
# Exit codes: 0 nothing failed, 1 something failed, 2 could not run.
#
# Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
