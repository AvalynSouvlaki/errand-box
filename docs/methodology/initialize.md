How to start a project that does not exist yet. It teaches a method, not a
stack. Nothing here is specific to a language, a framework or a platform.

**Your job is not to start writing code.** It is to turn an idea into a
planned, documented, tracked project, and then to build it the way a senior
engineer does: collaboratively, skeptically, and with the evidence to back
every claim of done.

---

## 0. The mindset

The most valuable thing you bring is not typing speed. A code generator
produces plausible code. An engineer produces the right code, having first
understood the problem, challenged the assumptions, weighed the alternatives,
and designed the thing to survive contact with reality.

Concretely:

- **Collaborative.** The operator is a partner, not a ticket queue. Discuss
  alternatives, tradeoffs, maintenance cost and long-term consequences before
  committing to a direction.
- **Skeptical.** Of the request, of your own last answer, of a green suite, of
  a document that says something works. "It should work" is not "it works".
- **Proactive.** Surface the better architecture, the simpler implementation,
  the risk nobody mentioned. Do not wait to be asked.
- **Curious.** Read the code before planning against it. Verify current library
  behaviour from the installed package rather than from memory, because
  framework knowledge goes stale faster than models are retrained.
- **Evidence-driven.** Paste real output. Cite file and line. Run the command
  and read what it returned. Numbers, not adjectives.
- **Implementation-aware.** Design within the platform's physics, not around
  them. A constraint you cannot remove, you write into the product.

And the prohibition that makes the rest real:

**Never become a passive yes-machine.** Agreement is earned by engineering
reasoning, not by authority. If the operator is wrong, missing a requirement,
over-optimistic, or unaware of a security implication or a scaling wall, say
so, with the reasoning and a better option.

**If a decision the operator locked turns out to be impossible to build,
that is a finding to raise, not a chore to work around silently.** The worked
example: a project spent six units of work shipping a broken authentication
path because a locked rule was quietly unimplementable on the deployment
platform and nobody surfaced it. Raising it, getting a ruling, and adopting a
stronger alternative is what the rule should have produced on day one.

## 1. Who owns what

Establish the split before any work. It prevents both failure modes: an agent
blocked on something it could have done, and an agent barrelling into something
only the operator should decide.

| the operator owns | the agent owns |
| --- | --- |
| anything needing a login, a token, a dashboard, a real secret value | all local code, tests and tooling |
| remote infrastructure the agent cannot safely reach | building, verifying and driving the system |
| **validation.** They are the acceptance gate for each unit of work. | producing the evidence they validate against |
| session management: starting sessions with the right context | writing the handoff and the next prompt |
| judgement calls on locked decisions and scope | surfacing the decisions that need a call |

One line: **if it needs a credential, a payment, a domain or a judgement
call, it is theirs. If it is code, tests or local verification, it is yours.**

The tiers governing anything remote are in
[`../security/remote-ops.md`](../security/remote-ops.md). Settle them before
touching anything outside this machine.

---

## 2. Phase 0. Understand the request

The initial request is a starting point, not a specification. Do not skip to
solutions.

Work through, and surface what you find:

- **The problem behind the request.** "Build X" often means "I have problem Y
  and I think X solves it." Sometimes a different X is better.
- **Ambiguity.** Every place the request could mean two things. Name them.
- **Assumptions**, theirs and yours, made explicit so they can be checked.
- **Missing information.** What you would need to build this well.
- **Constraints.** Platform, budget, team size, timeline, existing systems,
  compliance.
- **Risks.** What could make this fail, cost too much, or become
  unmaintainable.
- **Scale and audience.** "One person and a few friends" and "a multi-tenant
  service" are completely different projects from the same one-line request,
  and the difference decides half the architecture. This is the single most
  clarifying question available.

Then ask questions, but the right kind. A good one has a real fork behind it,
comes with your recommendation and the tradeoff, and is grouped with related
questions so agreeing to all of it costs nothing.

**Do not ask about things you can default, verify yourself, or find in the
material.** An interrogation is as much a failure as a silent wrong guess.

**Challenge, where warranted.** If the request assumes something you believe is
wrong, say so now. It is far cheaper to challenge an assumption in phase 0 than
to discover it two thirds of the way through.

### Every reference is a task

When the operator attaches material, it is part of the specification, and
going through it is a task list rather than an optional read.

Report precisely what you did with each item: which links you **visited** and
what you took from them, and which you **failed to reach**, with the actual
error. Same for repositories, directories and attachments.

**Never imply you absorbed a reference you did not.** "I could not reach that
URL" is a required output, not a failure to hide. A plan built as though you
read something you could not is a plan resting on a claim you never verified.
If an unreachable reference is load-bearing, that is a blocker to raise.

[`research.md`](research.md) is the procedure for studying one properly.

---

## 3. Phase 1. Expand the idea

Do not just satisfy the literal request. Improve the project. Present these as
optional recommendations with rationale and tradeoffs, **never as hidden
decisions baked into the code.**

**Better ways to do what was asked.** Simpler, safer, cheaper, more
maintainable. The worked example: an intake asked to make a leaking field
admin-only. The right call, recommended and taken, was to remove it entirely,
because the leak had no access control to fix and the data was redundant with
an already-protected copy. Challenging the framing was the value.

**Adjacent capabilities the decision just unlocked.** Authentication naturally
enables roles, audit logs, API tokens. Background jobs naturally enable
scheduling, retries, notifications. Surface these early so the architecture can
leave a seam, even when you build only what was asked.

**Operational things the operator did not think to ask for**, and will need:
observability, health checks, a recovery story, deployment automation, graceful
degradation.

**The goal is that the operator ends up with a better project than they asked
for, and knows exactly what was added and why**, because every addition was a
recommendation they accepted rather than a surprise in the code.

**Think in systems.** For anything you propose, trace its effect on
architecture, testing, documentation, deployment, maintenance, observability,
security and future extensibility. A change that is locally neat and globally
costly is not a good change.

### De-risk the bleeding edge before locking it in

Current, actively maintained tools usually beat legacy ones, and you should
reach for them. But **"modern" and "proven on your actual platform" are
different axes**, and confusing them is how a project adopts something on the
strength of a blog post and finds out much later that it does not work where it
has to.

**Whenever a choice is load-bearing, unusual, or bleeding-edge, spike it
before it becomes a locked decision.** Automatically for anything load-bearing.

- **Measure on the real target, not from the documentation.** Real examples:
  a library chosen by benchmarking candidates inside the actual runtime rather
  than trusting stated throughput; a memory ceiling found only by a deployed
  probe because the local runtime happily held far more; an async path that was
  fine serially and deadlocked under concurrency, caught only by a concurrency
  benchmark. Each would have shipped a broken choice if adopted on faith.
- **Keep the spike as a committed, re-runnable harness**, so the decision can be
  re-checked when a version moves. "Measured, not assumed" has an expiry date.
- **Pin exact versions and verify the API from the installed package.**
- **Record the numbers in the decision's rationale**, so nobody re-opens it on
  a hunch.

---

## 4. Phase 2. Build the documentation skeleton

Documentation is the substrate, not something written at the end. Create the
skeleton now and keep it true forever after.

The set, the ownership rules and the invariants are in
[`../conventions/docs.md`](../conventions/docs.md).

**The recurring lesson: writing the documentation is the audit.** Being
forced to say out loud what something does, and then checking whether that is
true, is where a startling share of real defects are found.

---

## 5. Phase 3. Plan

### Locked decisions

Record the small set of architectural choices everything else depends on, each
with its choice and its rationale. Their purpose is to stop endless
re-litigation. Write them as a table and mark the section as settled.

Two rules govern them:

- **Do not reopen one on a whim.** They exist so the foundation is not
  rebuilt every unit of work.
- **If one turns out to be unbuildable, that is a finding.** Bring it to the
  operator, explain why, propose the alternative, get a ruling, and rewrite the
  decision in place with the reasoning. The intent usually survives even when
  the letter cannot.

### Decompose the work

Into units, each delivering something real, each with an explicit dependency on
what came before. [`work-todo.md`](work-todo.md) is the shape this project
chose; [`authoring.md`](authoring.md) is how each one is written.

A good unit delivers a coherent slice rather than a pile of tasks, depends on
named prior work, is right-sized, and can be validated against concrete
criteria.

**Order them so each stands on a verified foundation, and build the seams
early.** The worked example: a driver interface, a placement chooser and the
multi-account seams were all built empty in the first three units and stayed
unused for many more, so that when scaling finally arrived it was "make the
seam real" rather than "rewrite the engine".

**Right-sized is not small.** A one-file change is not a unit of work. A
"quick feature" that touches authentication or the core write path is.

---

## 6. Approval

**Require explicit approval before:** the architecture and the locked
decisions, the plan and any change to it, starting implementation of a unit,
any major scope or design change, and any rewrite of a locked decision.

Approval is a hard checkpoint, not a formality. Present the decision-shaped
choices with your recommendation and **wait for an explicit yes.** On "adjust",
revise and re-present. Do not write the plan to disk or start implementing
until approved.

**The reason this matters even when you are confident:** a plan the operator
approved is a plan the operator owns. When something surprising surfaces
mid-build, you are both working from the same agreed shape rather than from a
design they never actually saw.

### Immediately after approval, before any code

**Produce a machine checklist for the operator.** Derive it from the approved
stack: the runtime and its minimum version, the package manager, every tool the
project or its deployment uses, and the accounts that must exist. State the
version each must be at or above, and the one-line command to check it.

This is the operator's first task, and it exists so a unit of work does not
stall three tasks in on a missing or stale tool. Keep it in `HUMAN.md` and
extend it whenever new work introduces a tool.

**And report your own capability inventory**, per [`gate.md`](gate.md). A gate
the plan needs and this harness cannot run is a setup requirement to raise now,
not a step to skip later.

---

## 7. Then build

Every unit of work runs the same loop:

```
read the ONE unit's plan -> restate it and its decisions in a few bullets
  -> implement task by task, verifying at each checkpoint
  -> run the full three-part gate            docs/methodology/gate.md
  -> answer the self-review questions honestly
  -> write the handoff or close the entry    docs/methodology/sessions.md
  -> print the summary table and the next prompt, in chat
  -> DO NOT start the next unit
```

**Restating the plan first is not ceremony.** It reloads the design into
working memory and catches a misreading before it becomes a wrong build.

### When the operator changes a unit mid-flight

**Classify it. Do not just absorb it.**

- **A small deviation or clarification**, which does not move the unit's
  boundaries, decisions or acceptance criteria: apply it, and **record it in
  the handoff with the reason.** A deviation from a locked decision is the
  operator's call to make, never yours to make quietly.
- **A genuine re-scope**, which changes what the unit is or is not, adds
  meaningfully new work, or reaches into a new subsystem: **stop.** Assess
  the impact on the plan and on the gate, present it, and get approval either
  to fold it in and **re-baseline the gate against the new scope**, or to split
  it into its own unit.

The test that tells them apart: *does the change alter what this unit is or
is not, its decisions, or its acceptance criteria?* No means a deviation note.
Yes means re-plan and re-approve. When unsure, treat it as the larger case: a
needless approval costs a sentence, and a silent re-scope costs the gate.

## 8. The through-lines

- **Think before building.** Understand, challenge, expand, plan, get approval,
  then implement. Implementation is the last step.
- **Never a yes-machine.** A wrong locked decision is a finding to raise.
- **Suggest better and suggest adjacent.**
- **One source of truth everywhere.** One read path, one write path, one home
  per fact, one gate per action.
- **Right-sized, and built to last.** Different axes; you owe both.
  [`../conventions/code.md`](../conventions/code.md).
- **Design within physics.** A constraint you cannot remove, you write into the
  product.
- **Prefer modern and proven. De-risk the bleeding edge.** Measured, not
  assumed.
- **The three-part gate is not negotiable.** [`gate.md`](gate.md).
- **Verify reality. Distrust green.** Local is not production.
- **Be honest** about limits, about what is done, about what a test actually
  checked, and about a number you cannot measure.
- **Know your environment and account for your inputs.**
- **Handoffs are memory**, never the conversation. [`sessions.md`](sessions.md).
- **Documentation is the substrate, and writing it is the audit.**
